TASK ONE:
    Some key indicators for Verizon's top rated cloud computing engineers (CCEs):
        Coding (pre-requisite skill)
        Agility (learn as you work skill)
        Networking and communication (learn as you work skill)
            Internal
            External
    Meeting Notes:
        Sasha:
            New Priority Project
            Our new enterprise VPN solution backed by Squid proxy servers
            Support both Verizon internal employees and external customers for their secured connection to the Verizon Cloud Platform

        Project requirements:
            VPN service is 
                Always up and running
                Resilient to faulty components and can automatically recover from partial infrastructure failure with minimal human intervention
            Application can scale up and down in reaction to the amount of traffic (reduce cost)


        Tasks:
            Work closely with the product team
            Getting acquainted with the new product as to be able to develop effective test cases and scenarios.
            Responsible for
                Creating and maintaining the test environment, frameworks, and tools
                Evaluating potential third-party testing and automation tools fit for integration
                The processing, tracking, and escalating of test results.
            Testing includes necessary manual interference and automation.
                Testing criteria are dependent upon the stage of development
                Test results will be submitted to the development team for review and turn into change requests and bug reports after each sprint.
    Quiz:
        A VPN has many characteristics to enhance the security of cloud platforms, including but not limited to: mitigating public network vulknerabilities, providing access control, and identity protection.


TASK TWO
    PART ONE - Sprint Meeting
    PART TWO - Getting Set Up
    PART THREE - What Are The Three Cloud-Native Traits In Question?
        Redundancy
            Kill an instance (VM or container) of the app while it's running and || check if the app continues to work and provide service ||.
                This is to test that the system is stable enough for parts of its underlying resources to fail and not affect up time.
        Resiliency
            Kill an instance (VM or container) of the app while it's running and || check if the instance restarts/recovers with no human intervention, and continues to provide service ||. 
                This is to test the ability of the system to recover from failures and continue to function with minimal interaction.
        Least-Privilege
            Check that the app is not using admin or root level access.
                This is to ensure that the application is secure enough so that should there be a security breach it will likely be limited due to the restricted access and permission of the user running the external facing application.
    PART FOUR - Now Let's Run The Python Test Program
        PART FOUR.ONE - Redundancy Test
            Quiz
                For the application service to be up and running, it requires at least one pod to be running.
                    If the last pod in the application is killed, the application will experience downtime between the pod terminating and when it is brought back up.
        PART FOUR.THREE - Resilience Test
            Quiz   
                The total number of running pods will remain the same because the application is resilient enough to re-deploy a downed pod quickly and automatically.
        PART FOUR.FIVE - Least-Privilege Test
            Quiz
                Root is the super admin user with full permission.
                    Instead of the root user, there should be a dedicated service user (e.g., squid) that has just enough privilege to run the squid proxy VPN application and nothing else.
    PART FIVE - Wrapping Up


TASK THREE
    Tip to stand out
        It's not about what skills do you know.
        People who have the aptitude, who have the curiosity to learn, who are very much interested.
            I.e., passionate people
